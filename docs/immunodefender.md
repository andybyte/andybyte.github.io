## Immuno-Defender

![Immuno-Defender Teaser](/assets/images/immunodefender_teaser.png)

This project was the focus of my MSIS thesis at the University of Pittsburgh, and I am currently seeking funding and feedback to continue its development. You can read the full thesis <a href="http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/id/eprint/45354" target="_blank">here</a>.

**I'd love for you to playtest the game and share your feedback!** Please contact me to get a build for Mac or Windows (possibly Linux). You can [email me](mailto:andybytesmail@gmail.com) or [DM me on Discord](https://discord.com/users/andybyte).

## My Design and Development Process

The project underwent numerous iterations and prototypes before I began developing the final vertical slice. The video below showcases the game's evolution through these various stages of development.

## Mixed-Methods Evaluation

You can read my thesis, [Mixed Methods Evaluation of Immuno-Defenderâ€™s Player Experience and Learning Outcomes](https://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/45354/) to learn how I designed, developed, and then applied user research to evaluate the game's experience and learning objectives.
