Hello and welcome to my studio/lab where I combine research and game design to create mindful and meaningful experiences! Take a look and let's get in touch.

## Immuno-Defender

I'm currently seeking funding to further develop **Immuno Defender**, an educational 3D action game that teaches players about the immune system while they defend the body against pathogens. 

*You control a Nano-Bot and take part in your own immune system to fight against diseases in your body. Learn how the immune system works to overcome viruses and build immunity, or perish trying. It's up to you in this 3D action game.*

The game combines engaging gameplay mechanics with scientifically accurate immune system concepts, making learning about biology both fun and interactive. Designing, developing, and evaluating the vertical slice game was the focus of my <a href="http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/id/eprint/45354" target="_blank">MSIS thesis</a>.

## Bubble Bee

*Bubble Bee* (tentative title) is a current game I have been developing following the 2025 Global Game Jam. It's a simple game I wanted to make for my daughter who loves playing outside and blowing bubbles.
