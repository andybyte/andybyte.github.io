Hello and welcome to my studio/lab where I combine data science, user research, and game design to create mindful and meaningful experiences! Take a look, learn [about me](/about_me/), and let's get in touch.

## Immuno-Defender 🦠

I'm seeking funding to further develop **Immuno-Defender**, an educational 3D action game that teaches players about the immune system while they defend the body against pathogens. 

> *You control a Nano-Bot and take part in your own immune system to fight against diseases in your body. Learn how the immune system works to overcome viruses and build immunity, or perish trying. It's up to you in this 3D action game.*

The game combines engaging gameplay mechanics with scientifically accurate immune system concepts, making learning about biology both fun and interactive. Designing, developing, and evaluating the vertical slice game was the focus of my <a href="http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/id/eprint/45354" target="_blank">MSIS thesis</a>.

## Bubble Bee 🐝

*Bubble Bee* (tentative title) is a game I'm developing and playtesting following the 2025 Global Game Jam. It's a simple game I wanted to make for my daughter who loves playing outside and blowing bubbles.

You can play the pilot level online at its itch.io page (Firefox is supported):

## Other Games - Coming soon 🏗️

I'm creating a page to list more games I have made and have collaborated on. I'll link that page here when it's ready to share.

## Health Research and Data Science 🫀

Besides designing, developing, and evaluating experiences, I'm also a data scientist and user researcher for health research at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm creating a page about my past and current projects and publications. I'll link that page here when it's ready.
