Hello. 

I'm Andy and you have found my space on the internet. I'm very glad you're here.

For over a decade I have been building and learning to craft experiences that matter. Whether that is designing a game that entertains, developing and evaluating a game that teaches, or conducting clinical research of a mobile application that helps you learn about hypertension while measuring your blood pressure at home.

I have much to share with you, so please let me know if you want to learn more and connect with me. You can [email me](mailto:andybytesmail@gmail.com) or [DM me on Discord](https://discord.com/users/andybyte).
