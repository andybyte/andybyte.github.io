**Bubble Bee** is a charming arcade-style game where players control a friendly bee navigating through a field of flowers (and bubbles). In the spirit of open development, I will be sharing playtest results and my planned "next actions." My goal is to foster a public conversation with developers and players about effective playtesting and how we can collectively improve our games.

## About the Game

I made this game for the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/bubble-bee-8-2" target="_blank">2025 Global Game Jam</a> and decided I liked the concept of a simple platformer bee game that I would continue working on it.

In Bubble Bee, players control a bumble bee on a mission to pollinate flowers. The game features:

- **Intuitive Controls** - Easy to learn, fun to master
- **Colorful Graphics** - Bright, cheerful visual design
- **Engaging Gameplay** - Arcade-style mechanics that keep players coming back
- **Accessible Design** - Suitable for players of all ages

## Development Details

### Technical Implementation

### Design Goals

- Game mechanics design and balancing
