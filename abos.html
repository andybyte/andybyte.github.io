<meta name="description" content="The University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health is conducting three separate studies in Southwestern Pennsylvania focusing on personal, occupational, and environmental risk factors and the association with disease. A risk factor is an exposure or characteristic that puts you at greater risk for disease, (e.g., cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer). One study will exclusively investigate the relationship between these risk factors and the development of childhood cancers using recruited participants. The other two studies will replicate earlier work on acute health conditions, asthma and birth outcomes, using data from health records and registries.">

<p>We are studying the relationship between environmental risk factors, such as unconventional natural gas development activities, and acute health conditions in Southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>We are conducting two studies. One is about asthma diagnoses and exacerbations and the second one is about adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, in the following counties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Washington, and Westmoreland.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-research-being-done">Why is this research being done?</h2>

<p>We hope that the outcome of this study will add to our knowledge about the association of these health conditions and exposure to environmental risk factors, such as unconventional natural gas development activities.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-this-study-being-conducted">How is this study being conducted?</h2>

<p>We are not contacting anyone to participate in these studies of health conditions. All of the information that we need is already in existing records.</p>

<p><strong>Asthma</strong>: Information on asthma diagnoses and exacerbations will be obtained from a medical records data repository that provides clinical data to researchers. We will collect data on patients in the eight-county study area. The records will include information on dates of visits, dates of admissions, and prescriptions related to asthma, as well as residence location at time of visit/prescription from 2011 to the present.</p>

<p><strong>Birth Outcomes</strong>: Birth information will be obtained from Pennsylvania birth records from 2010 to the present. We are particularly interested in four birth outcomes: term (≥37 week) birth weight, preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks gestation), low 5-minute Apgar score (&lt;7), and small for gestational age. We will collect other information from birth records including the baby’s gender, characteristics of the mother, her pregnancy, and residence location at time of birth.</p>

<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>

<p>Researchers will not receive any identifying information on participants. Any information gathered for this research study will be kept strictly confidential and information will be aggregated so that no individual can be identified.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-paying-for-this-study">Who is paying for this study?</h2>

<p>The studies on acute health outcomes are funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.</p>
