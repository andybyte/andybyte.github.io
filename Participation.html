A risk factor is an exposure or characteristic that puts you at greater risk for disease, (e.g., cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer.) There are environmental, occupational, and personal risk factors which may be associated with an increased risk for ALS. We are exploring these risk factors in the hopes of identifying more about what causes this disease." />

    <h1 id="welcome-participants">Welcome Participants</h1>
<p>You are a participant if you received a letter about this study. Read on to learn more about your participation. If you have any questions, please contact us by email at <a href="ALSstudy@pitt.edu">ALSstudy@pitt.edu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-study-has-two-parts">The Study Has Two Parts:</h2>

<h3 id="part-1">Part 1:</h3>
<p>You will be asked to participate in a  30-minute web-based or telephone interview consisting of questions about where you have lived, what jobs you have held, background questions on your education, and personal risk factors such as smoking.  You will receive $10 for your time to complete this survey. At that time we will confirm your address and send you a consent form for part two which is the blood draw.</p>

<h3 id="part-2">Part 2:</h3>
<p>After we receive the consent form for the blood draw, someone from our office will contact you to set up an appointment.  A phlebotomist (a healthcare worker trained in drawing blood) from (Quest Diagnostics) will make a one-time visit to your home or come to your workplace to collect a sample of your blood.  The blood draw is paid for by the study, and there will be no cost to you or your insurance.  This should not take more than 20 â€“minutes of your time.   You will receive $50 for your time for providing approximately a one tablespoon serum sample.   Your blood sample will be labeled with a unique identification number instead of using your name or other personal information and sent to a lab for processing.</p>

<p>Your cooperation will further the work on finding the causes and hopefully a cure for ALS.</p>

<p><em>THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!</em></p>
