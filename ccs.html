<meta name="description" content="The University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health is conducting three separate studies in  Southwest Pennsylvania focusing on personal, occupational, and environmental risk factors and the association  with disease. A risk factor is an exposure or characteristic that puts you at greater risk for disease,  (e.g., cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer). One study will exclusively investigate the  relationship between these risk factors and the development of childhood cancers using recruited participants.  The other two studies will replicate earlier work on acute health conditions, asthma exacerbations, and  birth outcomes, using data from health records and registries.">

        <h2 id="what-are-we-studying">What are we studying?</h2>

<p>We are studying the relationship between childhood cancers and personal, occupational, and environmental risk factors. Childhood cancer is the third leading cause of death in US children, yet there are very few known risk factors. This study will consider some of the risk factors that may play a role. These include, but are not limited to, lifestyle behaviors, residential history, family medical history, occupational exposures, and exposure to hydraulic fracturing and other industrial pollutants.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-research-being-done">Why is this research being done?</h2>

<p>We hope that the outcome of this study will add to our knowledge of the personal, occupational, and environmental risk factors for childhood cancers.</p>

<h2 id="who-will-be-asked-to-participate-in-this-research-study">Who will be asked to participate in this research study?</h2>

<p>We are recruiting a case group—families of children with cancer—to compare to a control group—families of children without cancer. Eligible participants will be contacted by the project office regarding participation in this study.</p>

<p>For the case group, only parents will be asked to participate in this study if they have a child:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, Central Nervous System tumors, or Ewing’s/Bone cancer between 2010-2019</li>
  <li>Who was age 0-19 at the time of diagnosis</li>
  <li>Resided in one of the following Pennsylvania counties:
    <ul>
      <li>Allegheny County</li>
      <li>Armstrong County</li>
      <li>Beaver County</li>
      <li>Butler County</li>
      <li>Fayette County</li>
      <li>Greene County</li>
      <li>Washington County</li>
      <li>Westmoreland County</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For the control group, the participants will be matched to the case group on age, sex, race, and county. Only parents will be asked to participate in this study.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-parents-be-asked-to-do">What will parents be asked to do?</h2>

<p>Participants will be asked to complete a 45-60 minute telephone interview about personal, occupational, and environmental risk factors. Participants will be compensated for their time.</p>

<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>

<p>Any information provided for this research study will be kept strictly confidential and information will be aggregated with no individual identification.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-paying-for-this-study">Who is paying for this study?</h2>

<p>The study is funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.</p>
